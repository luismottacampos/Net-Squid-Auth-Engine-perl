Net-Squid-Auth-Engine

External Authentication Engine for the Squid HTTP Cache, implemented in Perl.

This Module reads a configuration file and starts an infinite loop, reading a
line from the STDIN, capturing the username and password from the line, passing
it in to a plugin (defined by the configuration file) for validation, and
printing "OK\n" or "ERR\n" to the STDOUT, to indicate that the credentials
presented are or aren't valid.

This package also provides an interface to the Squid HTTP Cache through the
script squid-auth-engine, shipped with it. Please read the POD documentation in
the script for information about how to use it to authenticate Squid users
through an external credentials repository.
